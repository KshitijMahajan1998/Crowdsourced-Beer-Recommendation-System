# Crowdsourced-Beer-Recommendation-System

The objective of this group assignment is to create the building blocks of a 
crowdsourced recommender system. It should accept user inputs in the form of desired attributes of a 
product and come up with 3 recommendations. 
Obtain reviews of craft beers from beeradvocate.com. I would suggest using the following link, which 
shows the top 250 beers sorted by ratings: 
https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/
The nice feature of the above link is that it is a single-page listing of 250 top-rated beers (avoids the 
pagination feature, which you need in cases where listings go on for many pages). The way 
beeradvocate.com organizes reviews is that it provides about 25 reviews per page. The output file 
should have 3 columns: product_name, product_review, and user_rating.
